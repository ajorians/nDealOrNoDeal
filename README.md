A game for the TI-NSpire calculator based on the TV show

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It is played much like the television show of a similar name.  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1 and should work on all of the TI-nspire models.  The goal is to get the best amount possible.  This may mean taking a deal from the banker or it may be by declining every offer.  I hope you enjoy it!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nDealOrNoDeal-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 4 and 6 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game.
Use the arrow keys (or 2,4,6 and 8 keys) or use the touchpad to move the selector around the board.
Use the Enter (or Ctrl) key to select a case.

At the beginning of the game you pick a case to set aside.  If you decline every offer this will be the case you will be left with.  If you accept an offer you'll find out what was in the case.

To make the game more fun there is a player standing.  The outcome of the game affects your player standing.  So for example if you accept a offer and your case was worth more your points decrease.  Likewise if you never accept an offer and the case is worth less than the last offer your points decrease.  If you accept the offer and it was worth more than your case your points increase or if you open your case and your case was worth more than the prior offer your points increase.

I included my source.  I programmed with C++ which you can find out more here: http://blog.tangrs.id.au/?p=712  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
